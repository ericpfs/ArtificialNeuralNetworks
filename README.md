# ArtificialNeuralNetworks

A small collection of Jupyter notebooks that teach core neural-network ideas with PyTorch and Keras/TensorFlow. Each notebook is self-contained and focuses on one concept: classification, regression, autoencoders, and optimizer behavior.

# Contents

classification_example.ipynb – CNN classifier on Fashion-MNIST (Conv → BN → ReLU, downsampling, confusion matrix & report).

Autoencoders.ipynb – MLP/CNN autoencoders on MNIST/Fashion-MNIST; reconstruction, latent visualization, and k-NN from embeddings.

regression.ipynb – Function approximation: train an MLP to learn a smooth “bowl + ripples” surface; 3D plots and error heatmap.

compare optimizers training.ipynb – Side-by-side training curves for SGD/Adam/… with identical models.

2lnn vs basic linear regression.ipynb – Linear vs 2-layer NN on a simple regression task.
